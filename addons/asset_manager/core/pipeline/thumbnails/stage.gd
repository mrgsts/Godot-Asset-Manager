## Third import stage: generates thumbnails for everything the scan found.
## Not an import runner. Runners execute inside WorkerThreadPool.add_task()
## (import.gd), and viewport capture is main-thread only
## (scene/main/node.h's thread guards), so a runner physically cannot do the
## 3D half of this work. Runners also run per-type in parallel, while
## thumbnails need the finished index.
## Two kinds of renderer, declared by each type's thumb.gd:
##   WORK_WORKER  , pure decode/resize, safe to fan out across threads
##   WORK_VIEWPORT, needs a live viewport, main thread only, drained in order
