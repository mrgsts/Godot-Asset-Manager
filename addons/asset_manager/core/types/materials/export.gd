extends RefCounted
## Copies a .tres material plus every texture file it references, so the copy
## isn't broken once it's inside the project. Same "main file + its
## dependencies" shape as ModelsExportHandler's GLTF handling, just reading
## a .tres's ext_resource paths instead of a GLTF's JSON. Reuses
## TresMaterialLoader.parse_texture_paths() (already built for the materials
## preview) rather than re-parsing the .tres format a second way.

## dest_path is the FULL final destination path for source_path itself
## (already computed by export.gd's export_asset(), subfolder and all), not
## a directory to join a filename onto. Texture dependencies are re-derived
## off of dest_path's base dir, same as ModelsExportHandler.
