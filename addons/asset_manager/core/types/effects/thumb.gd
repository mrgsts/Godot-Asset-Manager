## Thumbnail renderer for effects.
## An effect at frame zero has emitted nothing, a naive capture is an empty
## tile. Every emitter is given a `preprocess` to fast-forward in a single
## frame, rather than waiting real frames for particles to build up.
## Only 3D effects are captured. A 2D effect draws through a Node2D canvas,
## not into the 3D world the shared viewport renders, falls back to the type
## icon.

## Zero, the animated capture starts each strip at the effect's own frame zero,
## a preprocess would skip past the part worth showing. Stays a named constant
## as the knob if a still capture ever needs the effect already developed.
